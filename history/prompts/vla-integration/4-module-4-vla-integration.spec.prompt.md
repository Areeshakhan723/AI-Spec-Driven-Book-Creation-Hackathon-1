  Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
  Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.
  Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.
  Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
  Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.
