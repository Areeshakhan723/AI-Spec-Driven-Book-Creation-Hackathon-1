# Content Standards: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Feature**: 1-ros2-nervous-system
**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Status**: Completed

## Purpose

This document establishes the content standards and quality guidelines for the ROS 2 educational module. These standards ensure consistency, quality, and educational effectiveness across all content in the module.

## Educational Standards

### Target Audience Alignment
- **Level**: Written for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics
- **Assumptions**: Readers have basic programming knowledge
- **Accessibility**: Concepts explained without assuming prior robotics expertise
- **Progression**: Content builds from fundamental to advanced concepts

### Learning Objectives
Each piece of content must clearly address specific learning objectives:
- Define what learners should understand after reading
- Include practical applications of theoretical concepts
- Provide assessment mechanisms (quizzes, exercises)
- Enable self-validation of learning outcomes

### Clarity and Comprehension
- **Plain Language**: Avoid jargon without explanation
- **Active Voice**: Use active voice when possible
- **Concrete Examples**: Support abstract concepts with specific examples
- **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams for complex relationships
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms for the same concepts

## Technical Accuracy Standards

### Information Verification
- All technical information must be verified against official ROS 2 documentation
- Code examples must be tested and confirmed functional
- References to ROS 2 features must match current version capabilities
- Links to external resources must be current and valid

### Content Currency
- Regular review schedule for technical accuracy
- Clear indication of ROS 2 version compatibility
- Updates synchronized with ROS 2 release cycles
- Deprecation notices when applicable

## Content Structure Standards

### Document Organization
- **Frontmatter**: Each document includes required metadata
- **Headers**: Logical hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3 → h4)
- **Sections**: Limited to 3-7 main sections per document
- **Length**: Aim for 5-15 minute reading time per document

### Navigation and Cross-References
- **Internal Links**: Use relative paths for internal references
- **Forward References**: Indicate when concepts will be covered later
- **Backward References**: Link to foundational concepts when needed
- **External Links**: Open in new tabs when appropriate

## Writing Standards

### Style Guidelines
- **Voice**: Professional but approachable
- **Tense**: Present tense for general truths, past tense for historical context
- **Point of View**: Third person for objectivity
- **Pronouns**: Use "you" to address the learner directly

### Formatting Standards
- **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighting for all code examples
- **Emphasis**: Use bold for key terms, italics for emphasis
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for unordered lists, numbered for sequential steps
- **Tables**: Use for comparison of features or options

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Review Process
- **Peer Review**: Technical content reviewed by domain experts
- **Editorial Review**: Language and style consistency check
- **Learner Review**: Pilot testing with target audience
- **Accessibility Review**: Compliance with WCAG guidelines

### Validation Criteria
- **Completeness**: All required topics from specification addressed
- **Accuracy**: Technical information verified against official sources
- **Effectiveness**: Learning objectives achievable through content
- **Consistency**: Standards applied uniformly across all content

## Content Maintenance Standards

### Update Process
- **Change Tracking**: Document reasons for content changes
- **Version Control**: Use Git for content versioning
- **Review Schedule**: Annual review of all content for accuracy
- **Feedback Integration**: Process and incorporate user feedback

### Deprecation Policy
- **Notification**: Clear indication of deprecated features
- **Alternatives**: Provide recommended alternatives when available
- **Timeline**: Reasonable timeframe for transition to new approaches
- **Documentation**: Maintain legacy documentation during transition

## Multimedia Standards

### Image Guidelines
- **Resolution**: High enough for clear viewing at 100% zoom
- **Format**: PNG for diagrams, JPEG for photos
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alt text for accessibility
- **Caption**: Contextual captions explaining image relevance

### Code Example Standards
- **Completeness**: Full, runnable examples when possible
- **Comments**: Inline comments explaining key concepts
- **Dependencies**: Clear listing of required packages/libraries
- **Output**: Expected output included where relevant

## Assessment Standards

### Exercise Design
- **Clarity**: Instructions clearly state what learner should do
- **Achievability**: Exercises match learner's current knowledge level
- **Relevance**: Exercises reinforce key concepts from content
- **Solution**: Clear, well-explained solutions provided

### Quiz Standards
- **Objectivity**: Questions have clear, unambiguous correct answers
- **Coverage**: Questions test understanding of key concepts
- **Difficulty**: Mix of basic, intermediate, and advanced questions
- **Feedback**: Explanations provided for correct and incorrect answers

## Compliance Standards

### Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Meet accessibility guidelines for web content
- **Screen Reader**: Content navigable with screen readers
- **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast for readability
- **Alternative Text**: All images have descriptive alt text

### Legal Compliance
- **Attribution**: Proper attribution for third-party content
- **Copyright**: Respect copyright of external resources
- **Licensing**: Clear licensing information for all content
- **Privacy**: No personal information collected without consent
