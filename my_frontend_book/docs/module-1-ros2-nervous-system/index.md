# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of our AI and Robotics educational book. This module focuses on ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots, designed for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain what ROS 2 is and its role in robotics
- Understand why ROS 2 matters specifically for humanoid robotics
- Describe DDS (Data Distribution Service) concepts and their importance
- Recognize the "nervous system" metaphor in robotics
- Implement basic ROS 2 communication patterns using rclpy
- Create URDF files for humanoid robot descriptions

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI** - Core concepts and DDS foundations
2. **ROS 2 Communication Model** - Practical communication patterns with rclpy
3. **Robot Structure with URDF** - Robot description and simulation readiness

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics with basic programming knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (preferred but not required)
