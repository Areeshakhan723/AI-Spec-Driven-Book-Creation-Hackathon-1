# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of our ROS 2 and Humanoid Robotics educational book. This module focuses on NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem for creating AI-driven robotic brains, covering photorealistic simulation, accelerated perception, and intelligent navigation for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for accelerated perception, VSLAM, and navigation
- Nav2 path planning specifically adapted for humanoid robots

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI engineers working with robotics applications
- Robotics developers implementing perception and navigation systems
- Advanced students working on humanoid robot projects

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Knowledge of simulation environments (covered in Module 2)
- Basic understanding of computer vision and navigation concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Set up and use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic humanoid robot simulation
2. Implement accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
3. Configure Nav2 for humanoid-specific navigation requirements
4. Integrate perception, navigation, and planning for complete AI-robot systems
