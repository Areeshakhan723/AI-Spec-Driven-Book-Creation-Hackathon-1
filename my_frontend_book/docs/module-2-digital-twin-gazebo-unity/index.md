# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of our ROS 2 and Humanoid Robotics educational book. This module focuses on creating digital twins using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:
- Physics-based simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) using Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU)
- Integration between different simulation platforms

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with basic Linux command line
- Basic programming knowledge

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Create physics-accurate simulations using Gazebo
2. Develop high-fidelity digital twins in Unity
3. Simulate and validate sensor data for humanoid robots
4. Understand the integration between Gazebo and Unity platforms
